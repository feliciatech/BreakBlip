# BreakBlip

Are you at the end of your rope with end-of-semester stress? We've all been there. That's why we created BreakBlip, find a burned-out buddy for a virtual companion in your burned-out time.

How it works:

Whenever you feel like you're crashing, just double-click the image of your little buddy. Instantly, your burned-out buddy's icon turns grey, visually sharing your moment of breakdown. Plus, it keeps track of break times, so you can see just how much you've conquered and emerged from those challenging burned-out moments.

Why you'll love it:

Empathy in a Click: Feel less alone as your buddy shares your stress.
Break Tracking: Keep a fun log of your breaks to understand your work patterns.
A Dash of Humor: Because sometimes, all you need is a little laugh to keep going.

Note: Crash Buddy is designed for light-hearted fun and stress relief. Always take care of your mental health and seek professional support if needed.
